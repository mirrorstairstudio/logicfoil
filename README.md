[TODO] PROJECT LOGO HERE

# Logic Foil
Free your game logic from any framework or engines!

## What is it?
Library of components that will help you write game logic in C++ (More language support to be discussed).
This allows game logic to be independent of your choice of framework or engine when developing a game!

**Why should you have your game logic detached?**

[TODO] DIAGRAM HERE

By removing technical dependency, you have freedom to change your framework/engine without sacrificing the work poured 
into the game logic.

The goal of the library is also to minimize state-ful programming as much as possible, which makes testing, debugging 
and writing logic easier.

## Project Roadmap
